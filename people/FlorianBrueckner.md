I've worked with Florian a few times. He's that perfect kind of new designer, eager for excellence, and easy to iterate with. 

He designed the menu for Lemurs Chemistry 1.1, starting with engineer art on Sunday night, working all night with the team for the Monday morning deadline. 

His design made us proud of what we had done, what we had suffered so much for, in a way we hadn't for so long.
