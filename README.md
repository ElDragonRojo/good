# The Good List

This is a partial list of good companies and people I know to be ethical, smart, and hard-workingâ€”doing it the right way, for the right reasons. Names in bold are people with whom I have worked or know well enough to go so far as to risk my personal reputation to vouch for them.

This list should not be considered complete, nor does non-inclusion imply anything.
