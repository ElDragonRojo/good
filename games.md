Non-violent games by non-evil companies, as recommended by my Twitter stream. 

I've listed things with an "iOS > Mac > Other" bias, but many of these are available on other platforms. Use your least unfavorite search engine, or check the developers' sites, for different versions.

For starters, a lot of people recommended games by [PopCap](http://popcap.com). These guys are the kings of casual gaming for a reason, and have published games on platforms I've never even heard of. Here are their iOS offerings:

* [Bejeweled](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bejeweled/id479536744?mt=8)
* [Bookworm](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bookworm/id307176281?mt=8)

* [Zuma's Revenge!](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zumas-revenge!/id501499260?mt=8)

Someone recommended anything by [Llamasoft](http://minotaurproject.co.uk/frontpage.php). I would have said anything by [ngmoco:)](http://www.ngmoco.com/games.php), yet they were conspicuously absent from people's recommendations. Why is that?
