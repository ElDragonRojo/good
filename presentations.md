I asked people on Twitter, "What's the best presentation you've ever seen at a tech conference?"

Daniel Jalkut [{t}](http://twitter.com/danielpunkass) the one that sticks with me the most as being great, even though I don't remember much, is Aaron Hillegass' [{t}](http://twitter.com/AaronHillegass) at C4[0] It was your pitch to developers to tackle niche markets like e.g. the dental office software that BNR did.

Gordon Hughes [{t}](http://twitter.com/GordonHughes): Bret Victor's [{t}](http://twitter.com/worrydream) Prototyping iPhone Interfaces at WWDC ‘09 has long been a standout for me. His more recent work is truly stellar.

Sam Noble [{t}](http://twitter.com/samnoble): probably SJ’s no-sdk shit sandwich

Robert Wijas [{t}](http://twitter.com/robertwijas): Aral Balkan's [{t}](http://twitter.com/aral) at nsconf 2011 was for a long time my no. 1, but now it’s the last Michael Lopp's [{t}](http://twitter.com/rands) talk that I can’t stop thinking about

Richar Feldman [{t}](http://twitter.com/rtfeldman): This one: http://t.co/Tq5SfJCDTz

littleknown: @bmf Just in terms of presentation, @lexfri & @dmoren at #cingleton 1

RuiAAPeres: @bmf for me the best one was given by @unclebobmartin

Cyriel [{t}](http://twitter.com/mindcrash): Wilson Miner's "When we build" at Build 2011 http://t.co/pGIrfmB9ec

diogot: @bmf the one that @twittelator did at altWWDC last year

bluecrowbar: @bmf Not sure about the best, but the funniest one by far was @daveaddey’s talk at last year’s @iosdevuk.

shawng: @bmf this one guy showed up with a friggin mariachi band!!
